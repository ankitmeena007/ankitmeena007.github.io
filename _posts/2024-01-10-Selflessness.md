# Is Selflessness really a thing?

Is there really anything such as complete selflessness? <br> 

Even the most noble acts can be claimed to have a reward associated with them. <br>

True selflessness would imply a complete separation of the self, <br> 

<i> leaving behind a soulless being </i>
