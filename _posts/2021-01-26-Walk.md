Come, let's go for a walk <br><br>

The silence of the night <br>
holds long lost voices <br>
carrying emotions a bit too many <br><br>

Of soldiers long forgotten <br>
who lost their worlds <br>
having to depart albeit unready <br><br>

Of those freely falling souls <br>
who clasped desperately at thin air <br>
wishing they knew what they had was beautiful already <br><br>

Of those future selves <br>
who remained future selves <br>
left floating in the abyss eternally <br><br>

Of those long queues of teenagers <br>
who finally became adults <br>
only to now go back so desperately <br><br>

Of those melancholic souls <br>
waiting on the deathbed <br>
their silence speaking volumes loudly <br><br>

<i> let's go for a walk, while we can. </i>
